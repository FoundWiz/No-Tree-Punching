This mod aims to make the start of the game harder.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction:
======================================================
This mod prevents punching logs in the early game.

This mod was inspired by No Tree Punching by AlcatrazEscapee. No Tree Punching is a great mod,
but I don't like the additional contents (ceramics and rock crafting),
so I made my own.

No Tree Punching (No Additional Features) adds only the No Logs and Stones Punching feature to the game,
no additional features (ceramics and rock crafting).

How to craft a Flint Hatchet:
======================================================
Step 1: Mine Gravel to acquire Flint.
Step 2: Harvest leaves for Stick.
Step 3: Craft Flint Hatchet.
